This penalty term helps to reduce the complexity of the model by shrinking some of the coefficients to zero. This makes it good for high dimensional data, its ability to perform feature selection, and to prevent overfitting(this means the model doesn't generalize enough and fits too closely to the training dataset). However, it fails when given non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable(like in this project), becomes very unstable when predictors are very correlated, introduces bias, etc.")

It combines linear algorithms(in this project, ridge regression using L2 penalty that doesn't fully bring coefficients to zero but still penalizes large coefficients) with powers(squared terms are used in this project). This makes it somewhat decent for non-linear relationships, since it boosts a linear algorithm's ability to do so, and very versatile and adaptable.

This makes it very robust and accurate, can handle non-linear relationships very efficiently, and can handle high-dimensional data well.

This makes gradient boosting regression have a high accuracy with non-linear relationships, can handle high-dimensional data well, and is very flexible and versatile.

Because of that, it's very good for non-linear relationships, simple to implement, and very versatile and adaptable when given new and unseen data.

This makes SVR very effective for high-dimensional data, can handle non-linear relationships well(if using the radial basis function kernel like in this project), and is robust to outliers.
